# BEST Hackathon 2024 - Insurance Premium Calculator Interface

Welcome to the Insurance Premium Calculator Interface repository!

## Overview

This repository contains a prototype of an interface that allows end users to calculate the premium for their insurance contracts. The interface is designed to provide a user-friendly experience for accessing premium calculations quickly and efficiently. It was done in a couple of hours, so it is still to be intended as a WIP.

## Technologies Used

The interface's code is written using a combination of Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. These technologies are woven together using the Flask framework, enabling seamless integration and functionality across the application.

## Awards and Recognition

The project's idea, which includes this interface, was awarded the winning title at the BEST Hackathon 2024, powered by Reale Mutua.
